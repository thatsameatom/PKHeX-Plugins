## Building  
This project requires an IDE that supports compiling .NET based code, such as Visual Studio 2022, and the [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0).

**Regular Builds**  
Regular builds will usually succeed unless there are changes that are incompatible with the NuGet [PKHeX.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PKHeX.Core) package dependency specified in the `.csproj` files of the projects. If building fails, use the bleeding edge method instead.

- Clone the PKHeX-Plugins repository using: `$ git clone https://github.com/Omni-KingZeno/PKHeX-Plugins.git`.
- Right-click on the solution and click `Rebuild All`.
- These DLLs should be placed into a `plugins` directory where the PKHeX executable is.
   - The compiled DLL `AutoModPlugins.dll` for AutoLegality will be in the `AutoLegalityMod\bin\Release\net9.0-windows` directory.

**Bleeding Edge Builds**  
Use this build method only if the regular builds fail. The Azure Pipelines CI will always use the bleeding edge build method. More details regarding this can be seen in the [azure-pipelines.yml](https://github.com/santacrab2/PKHeX-Plugins/blob/master/azure-pipelines.yml) file.

- Clone the PKHeX repository using: `$ git clone https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX.git`.
- Clone the PKHeX-Plugins repository using: `$ git clone https://github.com/Omni-KingZeno/PKHeX-Plugins.git`.
- Open the PKHeX solution, change your environment to `Release`, right-click on the `PKHeX.Core` project, and click `Rebuild` to build the project.
- Open the PKHeX-Plugins solution and right-click to `Restore NuGet Packages`.
- Next, replace the most recent NuGet packages with the newly-built `PKHeX.Core.dll` files.
   - Copy the `PKHeX.Core.dll` file located in `PKHeX.Core\bin\Release\net9.0` to the following folder with the most recent date:
       * `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\.nuget\packages\pkhex.core\YY.MM.DD\lib\net9.0`
- Right click the PKHeX-Plugins solution and `Rebuild All`. This should build the mod with the latest `PKHeX.Core` version so that it can be used with the latest commit of PKHeX.
- The compiled DLLs will be in the same location as with the regular builds. 

## Usage  
To use the plugins:
- Create a folder named `plugins` in the same directory as PKHeX.exe.
- Put the compiled plugins from this project in the `plugins` folder. If you downloaded the plugins from online, you will need to unblock them.
- Start PKHeX.exe.
- The plugins should be available for use in `Tools > Auto Legality Mod` drop-down menu.
